The only remaining issue is to adjust the CI to clone the modules before building the multi-site plugin and clone gerrit and link this and another modules in gerrit modules directory, before we can verify events-broker and global-refdb libraries.\n\n* [1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/plugins/multi-site/+/243660",
